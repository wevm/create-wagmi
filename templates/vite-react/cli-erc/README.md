This is a [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [@wagmi/cli](https://wagmi.sh/cli) project bootstrapped with [`create-wagmi`](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/wagmi/tree/main/packages/create-wagmi)

This template demonstrates usage of the [`@wagmi/cli` ERC Plugin](https://wagmi.sh/cli/plugins/erc).

# Getting Started

Run `npm run dev` in your terminal, and then open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

This command will also generate ERC20 + ERC721 React Hooks (via `npm run wagmi`) for you to use in your project.

Once the webpage has loaded, changes made to files inside the `src/` directory (e.g. `src/App.tsx`) will automatically update the webpage.
